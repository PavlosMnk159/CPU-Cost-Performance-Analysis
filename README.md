# CPU-Cost-Performance-Analysis

This project evaluates different CPU designs to determine which provides the **best computational performance relative to cost** for a data center. The goal is to maximize the ratio of performance to total cost of ownership (TCO), considering both hardware costs and energy consumption.

## Project Overview

- A benchmark program runs continuously on all CPUs to measure computational performance.  
- Multiple CPU designs are compared, accounting for factors such as clock speed, architecture, and energy usage.  
- The project identifies the CPU design that achieves the **highest performance per cost**.

## Key Features

- MIPS assembly benchmark program.  
- Comparison of multiple CPU designs.  
- Performance-to-cost optimization.

## Files

- `benchmark.s` – MIPS assembly benchmark program.  
- `README.md` – Project description.  

## Purpose

The project demonstrates how CPU design choices impact **performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness** in a data center setting.
